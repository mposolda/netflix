Acting on the New York stage by age 8 (opposite Ethan Hawke in "Sophistry"), she made her film debut two years later in Rob Reiner's North.<p>In 1996, Johansson's work in Manny & Lo caught the attention of Robert Redford, who cast her as Kristin Scott Thomas' daughter in The Horse Whisperer, a role that brought her widespread critical acclaim. From there, it was on to a co-starring role (opposite Thora Birch) in director Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World.<p>Johansson's sensitive turn opposite Bill Murray in Lost in Translation (2003) cemented her reputation as a serious, almost-grown-up actress, and she's worked steadily since in films, including The Girl with the Pearl Earring, The Island and Woody Allen's Match Point (2005).]]></bio><link href="http://api.netflix.com/catalog/people/164653/filmography" rel="http://schemas.netflix.com/catalog/titles.filmography" title="filmography"></link><link href="http://www.netflix.com/RoleDisplay/Scarlett_Johansson/164653" rel="alternate" title="web page"></link></person>
